# URL-Detector
Machine Learning Project

# Prerequisites:
Python 3.7.3
Tensorflow 1.14.0

# Introduction:
The project is still in progress.

The purpose of this project is to identify whether the URL is malicious.

Algorithm: Logistic Regression.
We found the data set, which is used to train the model on the Internet.
A total of 420,464 requests were sorted out as URLs data sets, including both legitimate and malicious requests.

We created a user-friendly webpage to provide the serving.

# Instruction:
## Server:
Located the file (MaliciousURLs.py) path in "Command Prompt".
Then type 'python MaliciousURLs.py' and press enter.
Open a browser and type the link shown on the Command Prompt.

## Client:
Type in an URL and then hit "submit," then you will get the result with the probability:
1. Thumb up: it is a legitimate URL.
2. Question mark: unsure.
3. Thumb down: it is a malicious URL.
